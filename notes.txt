search.js: SEARCH
  1. populate search results with specific class strings -- need to make sure that those show up in
     tailwind. Currently done through dummy.html

  2. The primary div is replaced by search div 'search-results' and 'primary' should be ids not
     class.

  3. search-container/mobileSearch/search-form - need to really undrestand this...


search.js OFFICER PAGE
1. update_panel: bulk changing of classlist based on elementID -- save all classes in dummy.html,
   technically should be able to bulk replace it
   
2. update_panel: hidden toggling in the manager design lines over there -- make sure hidden is not replaced
3. expand_ministry: toggle cursor-pointer
4. expand_ministry: toggle hidden
5. expand_ministry: toggle rotate-180
6. remove and lot of tags "pt-10", "lg:pt-0", "lg:order-none", order-10
7. order is dynamically populated based on the page -- I think best to ignore this entire. upside is 3 MB

search.js MINISTRY PAGE
1. bulk create minister panel - make sure the dummy.html has the classes there.
2. toggle hidden in deputy_pm div - don't touch the hidden class label
