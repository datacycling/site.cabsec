This information is available on their website in PDF documents. These documents describe various aspects of the organization - postings of officers, details about their financials, the activities they are doing etc. In fact, most government organizations are mandated by law to inform the public about their workings – they do it by issuing orders and government resolutions (GR).<p class="pt-5">Though the PDF documents provide a wide range of information - the fact that it is presented in PDFs make it very hard to correlate information across different (pdf) documents. The documents are designed for human consumption and are written in local Indian languages, their formats change over time and in most cases don't have identifiers for the key information presented in the document, further exacerbating the problem.<p class="pt-5">This inability to link information across documents makes any kind of analysis of the organization next to impossible. Also, it is very hard to get a complete picture of the organization – this is true for both people inside and outside the organization. Orgpedia aims to provide a technology solution for this problem.<p class="g-b">Orgpedia has two broad goals:<ol class="g-u"><li class="c-b"><b>Build information extraction technology:</b> The technology will extract the information from the pdf documents found in Indian public organizations – Indian languages, formats used in these organizations.<li class="c-b"><b>Present the information in a way that is easy to consume:</b> Make the information intuitive and actionable. This is achieved by developing higher level concepts, integrating with other public datasets and building novel data visualizations.</ol><p class="">All the extracted data, the software for the information extraction and presentation is in open source and is available on <a class="text-blue-500"href="https://github.com/orgpedia">GitHub</a>. In addition to open sourcing the data and the software, all the analysis will be presented in all <a class="text-blue-500"href="languages.html">22 official Indian languages</a> (the languages mentioned in the Eighth schedule of the Indian Constitution), along with English.<p class="pt-5">Orgpedia Foundation is a section 8 (non profit) company based in Pune, India.</div><div class="pt-5"><h4 class="i-o">Projects:</h4><div onclick='location.href="en/prime.html"'style="cursor:pointer"class="i-p"><div class=""><img src="i/cover-pager-img.png"alt=""></div><div class=""><h3 class="i-q">Ministers of India</h3><p class="i-r">Analysis of the ministers in the Indian Cabinet from 1947 to date.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></main></div><footer><div class="bg-gray-200 p-5 z-50 relative hidden lg:block"><div class="d-h"><div class="d-i"><img src="i/lf-en.svg"alt=""><div class="d-j"><p class="d-k"><a href="../disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a></div><div class="d-j"><p class="d-l"><a href="mailto:info@orgpedia.in?subject=index.html">Report an Error</a></div><div onclick='location.href="https://github.com/orgpedia/cabsec"'style="cursor:pointer"class="d-m"><span class="d-n"><a href="#">View on GitHub</a></span> <span class="d-o"><img src="i/gh.svg"></span></div><div class="d-p"style="cursor:pointer"onclick='location.href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"'><span class=""><img src="i/cc-1.svg"> </span><span class=""><img src="i/cc-2.svg"></span></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer"src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js"data-cf-beacon='{"token": "4b28ac948b94411393435f9ff3e233ef"}'></script></footer>
